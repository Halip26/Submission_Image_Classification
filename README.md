# Submission - Image Classification Project

## Dataset

- Use the [rockpaperscissors dataset](https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip) or use the following link in the wget command: `<https://github.com/dicodingacademy/assets/releases/download/release/rockpaperscissors.zip>`.

## Dataset Splitting

- Divide the dataset into a training set and a validation set.
- The size of the validation set should be 40% of the total dataset (1314 samples for training and 874 samples for validation).

## Image Augmentation and Image Data Generator

- Implement image augmentation.
- Use an image data generator.

## Model

- The model must use a sequential model.

## Model Training

- Model training should not exceed 30 minutes.

## Development Environment

- The program should be developed in Google Colaboratory.

## Accuracy Criterion

- The model should achieve a minimum accuracy of 85%.

## Image Prediction

- The program should be able to predict images uploaded to Colab, similar to the example :
  ![predicted results](output/predicted%20results.png)

## Personal Information

- Include personal information (according to the Dicoding profile) in the submission/project.
